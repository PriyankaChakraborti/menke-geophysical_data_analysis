    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Formulating inverse problems\n",
    "The starting place in most inverse problems is a description of the data.  Since in most inverse problems the data are simply a list of numerical values, a vector provides a convenient means of their representation.  If *N* measurements are performed in a particular experiment, for instance, one might consider these numbers as the elements of a vector **d** of length *N*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of data analysis is to gain *knowledge* through systematic examination of data.  While knowledge can take many forms, we assume here that it is primarily numerical in nature.  We analyze data so to infer, as best we can, the values of numerical quantities - *model parameters*.  Model parameters are chosen to be *meaningful*; that is, they are chosen to capture the essential character of the processes that are being studied.  The model parameters can be represented as the elements of a vector **m**, which is of length *M*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{data:} \\mathbf{d} = \\begin{bmatrix}d_1 & d_2 & d_3 & \\cdots & d_N \\end{bmatrix}^T \\\\\n",
    "\\text{model parameters:} \\mathbf{m} = \\begin{bmatrix}m_1 & m_2 & m_3 & \\cdots & m_M \\end{bmatrix}^T\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic statement of an inverse problem is that the model parameters and the data are in some way related.  This relationship is called the *quantitative model*.  Usually, the model takes the form of one or more formulas that the data and model parameters are expected to follow.  \n",
    "In realistic situations, the data and model parameters are related in complicated ways.  Most generally, the data and model parameters might be related by one or more implicit equations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "f_1(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{m}) = 0 \\\\\n",
    "f_2(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{m}) = 0 \\\\\n",

    "\\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{m}) = 0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where *L* is the number of equations.  These impliicit equations, which can be compactly written as the vector equation **f**(**d**, **m**) = 0, summarize what is known about how the measured data and the unknown model parameters are related.  The purpose of inverse theory is to solve, or \"invert,\" these equations for the model parameters, or whatever kinds of answers might be possible or desirable in any given situation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "No claims are made either that the equations contain enough information to specify the model parameters uniquely or that they are even consistent.  One of the purposes of inverse theory is to answer these kinds of questions and provide means of dealing with the problems that they imply.  In general, **f**(**d**, **m**) = 0 can consist of arbitrarily complicated (nonlinear) functions of the data and model parameters.  In many problems, however, the equation takes on one of several simple forms.  It is convenient to give names to some of these special cases, since they commonly arise in practical problems; we shall give them special consideration in later chapters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Implicit linear form\n",
    "The function **f** is linear in both data and model parameters and can therefore be written as the matrix equation:\n",

    "\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{m}) = 0 = \\mathbf{F} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{d} \\\\ \\mathbf{m} \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{Fx}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **F** is an $L \\times (M+N)$ matrix and the vector **x** = $[\\mathbf{d}^T, \\mathbf{m}^T]^T$ is a concatenation of **d** and **m**, that is, **x** = $\\begin{bmatrix}d_1 & d_2 & \\cdots & d_N & m_1 & m_2 & \\cdots & m_M \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Explicit form\n",
    "In many instances, it is possible to separate the data from the model parameters and thus to form *L=N* equations that are linear in the data (but still nonlinear in the model parameters through the vector function **g**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Explicit linear form\n",
    "In the explicit linear form, the function **g** is also linear, leading to the *NxM* matrix equation (where *L=N*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{m}) = 0 = \\mathbf{d} - \\mathbf{Gm}\n",

    "### 1.2 The linear inverse problem\n",
    "The simplest and best-understood problems are those that can be represented with the explicit linear equation **Gm** = **d**.  This equation, therefore, forms the foundation of the study of discrete inverse theory.  As will be shown below, many important inverse problems that arise in the physical sciences involve precisely this equation.  Others, while involving more complicated equations, can often be solved through linear approximations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix **G** is called the data kernel, in analogy to the theory of integral equations, in which the analogs of the data and model parameters are two continuous functions *d(x)* and *m(x)*, where *x* is some independent variable.  Continuous inverse theory lies between these two extremes, with discrete data but a continuous model function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\qquad\n",
    "d(y) = \\int G(y,x) m(x) dx\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference among discrete inverse theory, continuous inverse theory, and integral equation theory is whether the model *m* and data *d* are treated as continuous functions or discrete parameters.  The data $d_i$ in inverse theory are necessarily discrete, since inverse theory is concerned with deducing knowledge from observational data, which always has a discrete nature.  Both continuous inverse problems and integral equations can be converted to discrete inverse problems by approximating the model *m(x)* as a vector of its values at a set of *M* closely spaced points.\n",

    "### 1.3 Examples of formulating inverse problems\n",
    "#### 1.3.1 Example 1: Fitting a straight line\n",
    "Suppose that *N* temperature measurements $T_i$ are made at times $t_i$ in the atmosphere.  The data are then a vector **d** of *N* measurements of temperature, where $\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{bmatrix} T_1 & T_2 & \\cdots & T_N \\end{bmatrix}^T$.  The times $t_i$ are not, strictly speaking, data.  Instead, they provide some auxiliary information that describes the geometry of the experiment.  \n",

    "Suppose that we assume a model in which temperature is a linear function of time: $T = a + bt$.  The intercept *a* and slope *b* then form the two model parameters of the problem, $\\mathbf{m} = [a, b]^T$.  According to the model, each temperature observation must satisfy $T_i = a + bt_i$:\n",

    "Computations with sparse matrices can be made extremely efficient by storing only the nonzero elements and by never explicitly multiplying or adding the zero elements (since the result is a foregone conclusion).  However, special software support is necessary to gain this efficiency, since the computer must keep track of the zero elements.  In *Python*, the **CSR** format from the *SciPy* package is specially suited for fast matrix vector products.  "

    "Not every inverse problem can be adequately represented by the discrete linear equation **Gm** = **d**.  Consider, for example, a spectrogram containing a set of emission or absorption peaks, that vary with some auxiliary variable *z*.  The positions *f*, area *A*, and width *c* of the peaks are of interest because they reflect the chemical composition of the sample.  Denoting the shape of the peak *j* as $p(z_i, f_j, A_j, c_j)$ is taken to be a *Lorentzian*.  The data and model are therefore related by the *nonlinear* explicit equation **d** = **g**(**m**), where **m** is a vector of the position, area, and width of each peak.  This equation is inherently nonlinear.  \n",

    "Another example of a nonlinear inverse problem is that of determining the composition of chemical end members on the basis of the chemistry of a suiute of mixtures of the end members.  Consider a simplified \"ocean\" in which sediments are composed of mixtures of several chemically distinct rocks eroded from the continents.  One expects the fraction of chemical *j* in the *i*th sediment sample $S_{i,j}$ to be related to the amount of end-member rock in sediment sample $i(C_{i,k})$ and to the amount of the *j*th chemical in the end-member rock ($F_{k,j}$) as:  \n",

Since the data **S** are on one side of the equations, this problem is also of the explicit nonlinear type.  Note that basically the problem is to factor a matrix **S** into two other matrices **C** and **F**.  This factoring problem is a well-studied part of the theory of matrices, and methods are available to solve it.  "
